That's ok! Here are some tips to take to your next feature kickoff or UI copy review to make sure your UI copy won't embarrass you or distract from your awesome new app or feature.</p></blockquote>

				<p>I'm a Technical Writer. My organization relies on me to know words - lots of them - and to know how to deploy them with professional precision. To be caught using the dictionary feature of my MacBook, which I do every day, felt like admitting ignorance implicitly.</p>

I don't think I'll ever get that way. Because when I was growing up every birthday I would wake up to balloons sprinkled about my room. I lived with my parents until I was 19.</p></blockquote>

First and most obvious is my content under the Technical Writing topic. My arrogance is in jest, because I don't feel I contribute enough to be considered an authority on the topic there.</p></blockquote>

As he sat slumped in his sports car on a hot summer day in Florida, onlookers filmed what was probably his last moments on Earth as someone checked him for a pulse.</p></blockquote>

But I'm not talking about how the industry is mostly straight white middle-class men, that story is already being told (üôåüèæ).</p></blockquote>

I also had a fondness for Tom & Jerry. Well, I had a fondness for Tom, at least.</p></blockquote>

The advice still holds up quite well I think. Well, it all depends (like most things in life).</p></blockquote>

Like everything I do writing-related, I put more effort into it than was necessary, to the point of my effort almost being ineffective (it was late, I was tired).</p></blockquote>

Our coffee skin with varying degrees of added cream leaves most folks unable to label us. Our un-identifiable hair texture leads to mislabeling and relabeling.</p></blockquote>

I've since relocated to another country where my surname is even less common, and I've eased up quite a bit about correcting people on how to pronounce "Paz." To my new friends and colleagues who might find their way of pronouncing my surname in this post, fear not, I still adore you.</p></blockquote>

While for some the choice to become a technical writer is obvious, the industry one chooses to work in is just as important as the initial decision to become a technical writer.</p></blockquote>
